#include <iostream>     //to read or write to the standard input/output streams
using namespace std;    //bad practice but using the libraries called std, emliminate the need to write like this:  std:: cout
int main(){             //main get the control of the program first.
    cout<< "comments";          //write to output stream.
    return 0;           //due to int main so it need to return an interger
}           //a block of code
